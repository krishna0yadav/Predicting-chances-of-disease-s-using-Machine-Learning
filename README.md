# Predicting-chances-of-disease-s-using-Machine-Learning

This project aims at developing a smart and efficient way of diagnosing patients for particular disease/s. 

It will provide an interface to feed-in the patientâ€™s medical data and store it in the database for further processing. The ML algorithm will be processing the medical data on the server and will predict whether the patient is suffering from the disease or not. The result will be reflected back on the user interface.
